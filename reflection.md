## What made it easier for you to implement the view?

The easiest part to implement in this activity, were the fixed `TextViews` and `ImageViews`. Also, all the containers and `CardViews` where very easy to implement. 

## What made it difficult for you to implement the view?

The most "difficult" part to implement where the dynamic Types, Stats and Moves of the pokemon, because I had to use an `Inflater` to create a list in the containers.
